# PROJECT
The purpose of the project is to develop a cloud-based platform for automatic gathering of data from multiple online sources or from the websites which are updating in every 15 minutes i.e. The data retrieved is in bulk. So, first we have to manage the data in by modifying it, then centralized that data and sent it to the cloud.
